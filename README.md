# BDIA-SafetyWalk

-----
Safety Walk is an innovative smartphone app for the visually impaired that helps them walk safely and smoothly. The app provides real-time voice signals to help users walk safely when crossing a crosswalk. It uses GPS and other sensor data to understand the userâ€™s current location and surroundings, and guides users to the optimal crosswalk route. It also uses data from public institutions to provide the location of pedestrian signals and provides users with the latest traffic conditions. Safety Walk aims to promote independent mobility for the visually impaired, prevent traffic accidents, and enhance social inclusion.
